**RetinaFace**

RetinaFace is a cutting-edge, single-stage face detection algorithm that leverages deep learning to accurately identify faces and localize their key facial landmarks (like eyes, nose, and mouth) even in challenging "in-the-wild" conditions. It achieves high performance by combining face box prediction, 2D facial landmark localization, and 3D vertices regression into a unified, efficient framework. Trained on large datasets like WIDER FACE, RetinaFace is widely used in various applications requiring robust and fast face detection.

**Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks - mtcnn**

[Joint Face Detection and Alignment using Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02878)

Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) is a popular and robust deep learning-based framework primarily used for face detection and facial landmark alignment. It operates in a cascaded three-stage architecture (P-Net, R-Net, O-Net) that progressively refines bounding box proposals and predicts five facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth corners) in a coarse-to-fine manner. This multi-task learning approach allows MTCNN to achieve high accuracy in detecting faces even in challenging "in-the-wild" conditions, making it a common choice for the initial stage of many face recognition pipelines.
