FastAPI pipeline for face matching and image pre-processing, aiming to enhance image analysis and recognition capabilities. Key progress includes building modules for image pre-processing and face matching, alongside API documentation. The InsightFace model achieved 83.02% accuracy (44/53 correct) in initial gender identification, used for filtering non-matching faces. Significant challenges were encountered with image quality issues like yellowing, fading, low resolution, poor lighting, and reflections, which impacted accuracy, and the inbuilt age detector showed low accuracy. Overall, while the core pipeline is being built, addressing image quality variations and improving age detection remain critical areas for further development.
